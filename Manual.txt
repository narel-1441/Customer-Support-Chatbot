Electrostatic discharge—ESD protection
ESD is a major concern when you handle electronic components, especially sensitive components such as expansion cards,
processors, memory modules, and system boards. A slight charge can damage circuits in ways that may not be obvious, such
as intermittent problems or a shortened product life span. As the industry pushes for lower power requirements and increased
density, ESD protection is an increasing concern.
Due to the increased density of semiconductors used in recent Dell products, the sensitivity to static damage is now higher than
in previous Dell products. For this reason, some previously approved methods of handling parts are no longer applicable.
Two recognized types of ESD damage are catastrophic and intermittent failures.
● Catastrophic – Catastrophic failures represent approximately 20 percent of ESD-related failures. The damage causes an immediate and complete loss of device functionality. An example of catastrophic failure is a memory module that has received a static shock and immediately generates a "No POST/No Video" symptom with a beep code that is emitted for missing or non-functional memory.
● Intermittent – Intermittent failures represent approximately 80 percent of ESD-related failures. The high rate of intermittent failures means that most of the time when damage occurs, it is not immediately recognizable. The memory module receives a static shock, but the tracing is merely weakened and does not immediately produce outward symptoms that are related to the damage. The weakened trace may take weeks or months to melt, and in the meantime may cause degradation of memory integrity, intermittent memory errors, and so on. Intermittent failures also called latent or "walking wounded" are difficult to detect and troubleshoot.

Perform the following steps to prevent ESD damage:
● Use a wired ESD wrist strap that is properly grounded. Wireless anti-static straps do not provide adequate protection. Touching the chassis before handling parts does not ensure adequate ESD protection on parts with increased sensitivity to ESD damage.
● Handle all static-sensitive components in a static-safe area. If possible, use anti-static floor pads and workbench pads.
● When unpacking a static-sensitive component from its shipping carton, do not remove the component from the anti-static packing material until you are ready to install the component. Before unwrapping the anti-static packaging, use the antistatic wrist strap to discharge the static electricity from your body.
● Before transporting a static-sensitive component, place it in an anti-static container or packaging.

ESD Field Service kit
The unmonitored Field Service kit is the most commonly used service kit. Each Field Service kit includes three main components: anti-static mat, wrist strap, and bonding wire.
CAUTION: It is critical to keep ESD-sensitive devices away from internal parts that are insulators and often
highly charged, such as plastic heat sink casings.

Working Environment
Before deploying the ESD Field Service kit, assess the situation at the customer location. For example, deploying the kit for a server environment is different than for a desktop or laptop environment. Servers are typically installed in a rack within a data center; desktops or laptops are typically placed on office desks or cubicles. Always look for a large open flat work area that is free of clutter and large enough to deploy the ESD kit with additional space to accommodate the type of computer that is being repaired. The workspace should also be free of insulators that can cause an ESD event. On the work area, insulators such as Styrofoam and other plastics should always be moved at least 12 inches or 30 centimeters away from sensitive parts before physically handling any hardware components.

ESD Packaging
All ESD-sensitive devices must be shipped and received in static-safe packaging. Metal, static-shielded bags are preferred.
However, you should always return the damaged part using the same ESD bag and packaging that the new part arrived in. The ESD bag should be folded over and taped shut and all the same foam packing material should be used in the original box that the new part arrived in. ESD-sensitive devices should be removed from packaging only at an ESD-protected work surface, and parts should never be placed on top of the ESD bag because only the inside of the bag is shielded. Always place parts in your hand, on the ESD mat, in the computer, or inside an anti-static bag.

Components of an ESD Field Service kit
The components of an ESD Field Service kit are:
● Anti-Static Mat – The anti-static mat is dissipative and parts can be placed on it during service procedures. When using an anti-static mat, your wrist strap should be snug and the bonding wire should be connected to the anti-static mat and to any bare metal on the computer being worked on. Once deployed properly, service parts can be removed from the ESD bag and placed directly on the anti-static mat. ESD-sensitive items are safe in your hand, on the anti-static mat, in the computer, or inside an ESD bag.
● Wrist Strap and Bonding Wire – The wrist strap and bonding wire can be either directly connected between your wrist and bare metal on the hardware if the ESD mat is not required, or connected to the anti-static mat to protect hardware that is temporarily placed on the mat. The physical connection of the wrist strap and bonding wire between your skin, the ESD mat, and the hardware is known as bonding. Use only Field Service kits with a wrist strap, anti-static mat, and bonding wire. Never use wireless wrist straps. Always be aware that the internal wires of a wrist strap are prone to damage from normal wear and tear, and must be checked regularly with a wrist strap tester in order to avoid accidental ESD hardware damage. It is recommended to test the wrist strap and bonding wire at least once per week.
● ESD Wrist Strap Tester – The wires inside an ESD strap are prone to damage over time. When using an unmonitored kit, it is a best practice to regularly test the strap prior to each service call, and at a minimum, test once per week. A wrist strap tester is the best method for doing this test. If you do not have your own wrist strap tester, check with your regional office to find out if they have one. To perform the test, plug the bonding-wire of the wrist-strap into the tester while it is strapped to your wrist and push the button to test. A green LED is lit if the test is successful; a red LED is lit and an alarm sounds if the test fails.
NOTE: It is recommended to always use the traditional wired ESD grounding wrist strap and protective anti-static mat when servicing Dell products. In addition, it is critical to keep sensitive parts separate from all insulator parts while servicing the computer, and use anti-static bags for transporting sensitive components.

Transporting sensitive components
When transporting ESD sensitive components such as replacement parts or parts to be returned to Dell, it is critical to place these parts in anti-static bags for safe transport.

Lifting equipment
Adhere to the following guidelines when lifting heavy equipment:
CAUTION: Do not lift greater than 50 pounds. Always obtain additional resources or use a mechanical lifting
device.
1. Get a firm balanced footing. Keep your feet apart for a stable base, and point your toes out.
2. Tighten stomach muscles. Abdominal muscles support your spine when you lift, offsetting the force of the load.
3. Lift with your legs, not your back.
4. Keep the load close. The closer it is to your spine, the less force it exerts on your back.
5. Keep your back upright, whether lifting or setting down the load. Do not add the weight of your body to the load. Avoid twisting your body and back.
6. Follow the same technique in reverse to set the load down.

Troubleshooting
Handling swollen rechargeable Li-ion batteries
Like most laptops, Dell laptops use Lithium-ion batteries. One type of Lithium-ion battery is the rechargeable Li-ion battery.
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries have increased in popularity in recent years and have become a standard in the electronics industry due to customer preferences for a slim form factor (especially with newer ultra-thin laptops) and long battery life.
Inherent to rechargeable Li-ion battery technology is the potential for swelling of the battery cells.
A swollen battery may impact the performance of the laptop. To prevent possible further damage to the device enclosure or internal components leading to malfunction, discontinue the use of the laptop and discharge it by disconnecting the AC adapter and letting the battery drain.
Swollen batteries should not be used and must be replaced and disposed of properly. We recommend contacting Dell Support for options to replace a swollen battery under the terms of the applicable warranty or service contract, including options for replacement by a Dell authorized service technician.
The guidelines for handling and replacing rechargeable Li-ion batteries are as follows:
● Exercise caution when handling rechargeable Li-ion batteries.
● Discharge the battery before removing it from the computer. To discharge the battery, unplug the AC adapter from the computer and operate the computer only on battery power. The battery is fully discharged when the computer no longer turns on when the power button is pressed.
● Do not crush, drop, mutilate, or penetrate the battery with foreign objects.
● Do not expose the battery to high temperatures, or disassemble battery packs and cells.
● Do not apply pressure to the surface of the battery.
● Do not bend the battery.
● Do not use tools of any type to pry on or against the battery.
● If a battery gets stuck in a device as a result of swelling, do not try to free it as puncturing, bending, or crushing a battery can be dangerous.
● Do not attempt to reassemble a damaged or swollen battery into a laptop.
● Swollen batteries that are covered under warranty should be returned to Dell in an approved shipping container (provided by Dell)—this is to comply with transportation regulations. Swollen batteries that are not covered under warranty should be disposed of at an approved recycling center. Contact Dell Support at Dell Support Site for assistance and further instructions.
● Using a non-Dell or incompatible battery may increase the risk of fire or explosion. Replace the battery only with a compatible battery purchased from Dell that is designed to work with your Dell computer. Do not use a battery from other computers with your computer. Always purchase genuine batteries from Dell Site or otherwise directly from Dell.
Rechargeable Li-ion batteries can swell for various reasons such as age, number of charge cycles, or exposure to high heat. For more information about how to improve the performance and lifespan of the laptop battery and to minimize the possibility of occurrence of the issue, search Dell laptop battery in the Knowledge Base Resource at Dell Support Site.

Locating the Service Tag or Express Service Code of your Dell computer

LCD-BIST section for 30 seconds and then turn off.
LCD Built-in Self-Test (BIST)
Dell laptops have a built-in diagnostic tool that helps you determine if the screen abnormality you are experiencing is an inherent
problem with the LCD (screen) of the Dell laptop or with the video card (GPU) and computer settings.
When you notice screen abnormalities like flickering, distortion, clarity issues, fuzzy or blurry image, horizontal or vertical lines,
color fade and so on, it is always a good practice to isolate the LCD (screen) by running the Built-In Self-Test (BIST).
How to invoke the LCD BIST
1. Turn off your computer.

key until the computer boots up.
5. The screen displays solid colors and change colors on the entire screen to white, black, red, green, and blue twice.
6. Then it displays the colors white, black, and red.
7. Carefully inspect the screen for abnormalities (any lines, fuzzy color, or distortion on the screen).
8. At the end of the last solid color (red), the computer shuts down.
NOTE: Dell SupportAssist Preboot diagnostics upon launch initiates an LCD BIST first, expecting a user intervention to
confirm functionality of the LCD.
