      "Review: I have been using laptops for the past 30 years, and haven’t bought a new one since 2013.  It was a special treat getting this new FusionTech G3. I’m not a crazy gamer, but I do play games. I was attracted to this computer because I wanted performance, and I know gamers expect high performance!<br />PROS:<br />-FAST FAST FAST. It is by far the fastest computer I’ve ever owned. I often blamed my speed on my Internet connection -- but am now discovering that my computer itself was at least 75% of the  problem.<br />-The graphics card is amazing!  My 10yr old nephew tried out Minecraft, Java Edition on my laptop. He gave it a 98/100.  The Frames Per Second rate started around 90+.  He gave it the TNT test (a fast animation to stress out the frame rate) and the frame rate dropped 30 then immediately recovered to the high level.<br />-The keyboard glows blue. Not only is it super cool, it’s easy to see in low light.<br />-Compared to other laptops I’ve had, this one is MUCH cooler (ie you can actually put it on your lap without burning your legs!). Yay for thermal cooling!<br />-Great battery life. So far, I have had zero issues with battery life. According to the battery icon, a full battery should last about 5 hours - which I fully believe.<br />-The power cord has a blue light where it plugs into the computer so you KNOW it’s charging!<br />CONS:<br />-It’s heavier than any laptop I’ve had - I assume because of the robustness of the machine.<br />-The power supply is HUGE - Again, I have to assume because of the robustness of the computer, but it seems unnecessarily large.<br />-For me personally, the keyboard is different than I’m used to.  It has a numeric keypad on the right end of the keyboard -- so the QWERTY keys are not as central as I’m used to. There are raised bits on the F&J so you can find home base, and on the center of the number pad, which is good. I think this will just take some getting used to the change.<br /><br />Overall, I’m elated by this laptop.  After having it for about 3 weeks, I have no regrets thus far.\n",
